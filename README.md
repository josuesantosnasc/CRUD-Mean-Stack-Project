# CRUD-Mean-Stack-Project
The foremost goal of this project was to practice Crud operations using MEAN Stack. The programm was designed to add some user's information,such as: name, position, office and salary. After filling all the empty inputs, user will submit the data in order to be saved in Mongo DB.
<br/><br/>
All data which was sent by user will show up on table, which is located beside the form. Each line of table has two buttons: edit button and delete button. When the user push one of them, it can change the data on desired table's line.
